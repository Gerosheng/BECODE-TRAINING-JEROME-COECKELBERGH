# How Does The Internet Work

## What is the Internet

**The Internet** is not a bubble cloud like many people think. It is more like a **wire**, buried in the ground made of either:

- fiber optics,
- copper or
- via beam to sattelites
- or through cellphone networks.

## What does it do

Thanks to it two **computers** connected to **the Internet** can _communicate_ between them.

A **servor** is special _computer_ connected to internet, while **web pages** are _files_ stored on that servor hard drive.

Every server has its own _IP address_ that helps computers finding each other, given easier to use names.

Home computers are _not connected_ directly to the internet, they are called **clients** because they are connected indirectly through an **Internet service provider**.

## How does it work

To send emails, messages are composed on a **dedicated servor/webpage** like gmail.com, then are sent to a receiving servor to which the recipient is connected to and can thus receive the message from.

An email, picture or webpage that is travelling through the internet is broked down into **packets** reassembled into their original form at destination.

Everything connected to the internet has an **IP address**. Anywhere where there is a connection between elements you'll an equipment called **router** that each _wraps or unwraps_ **packets** of information going through them depending on the sender and receiver.

And that's **how the internet works!**
