# How Does The Internet Works

The Internet is not a bubble cloud, it is more like a wire, buried in the ground made of either fiber optic, copper or desattelised.

Two computers connected to the internet can communicate between them

servor is special comp connected to internet, web pages are files stored on that servor hard drive

every server has its own Ip address that helps computers finding each other, given easier to use names

Home computers are not connected directly to the internet, they are called clients because connected indirectly through an Internet service provider. 

to sent email, messages are composed on a dedicated servor/webpage like gmail.com, that are sent to a receiving servor to which the destinary is connected and can thus receive the message from. 

an email, picture or webpage travelling through the internet it is brokedown intu packets reassembled into their original form at destination

everything connected to the internet has an ip address. anywhere were there is a connection between element you'll an equipment called router that each wraps or unwraps packets of information going through them depending on the sender and receiver

And that's how the internet works
